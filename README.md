- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sibmont
- 👀 I’m interested in Web Development, Game Development, App Development, Programming in C# for Unity, and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Full Stack, but I know a bit of C# and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a Game Development project or any kind of programming project where I can learn a lot more information about programming in general.
